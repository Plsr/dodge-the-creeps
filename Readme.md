# Dodge the Creeps

This is the code from the Godot Game Engine found [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html).
Most of the code is exactly as it was proposed in the tutorial. I pushed it here mainly for documentation
reasons, because I thought it might be fun to have that at some point in the future.

## What I changed
* Added a safe_space around the player and do not allow creeps to spawn in there
* Add a variable number of max creeps that can be on screen at the same time (would be the base to add levels of growing difficutly in the future)
